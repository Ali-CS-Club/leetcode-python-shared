# 📘 LeetCode Python Shared Repository

Welcome to **Ali CS Club's** shared repository for solving LeetCode problems using Python.  
This space is meant for **collaborative problem-solving, clean code sharing, and peer learning**.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Problems are organized by **difficulty level**:
  - [`easy/`](./easy/)
  - [`medium/`](./medium/)
  - [`hard/`](./hard/)

- Each problem should be saved as a separate `.py` file.
- File names should use **snake_case** and be descriptive of the problem (e.g., `two_sum.py`, `longest_substring.py`).
- Include metadata (like problem title and link) in comments at the top of each file.
